Let your objects follow them.\r\n  * **A* pathfinding** und user definable grids of nodes. It doesn't have to be a grid of squares!\r\n  * Easy **integration of Box2D** powered physics including ray casting. Physics definition created by the tool PhysicsEditor are supported too.\r\n  * **Localize your game** easily with easy support of multiple languages.\r\n  * Support different key maps for different controllers or user definitions.\r\n  * Embedded objects inside a Tiled map will be stored and are accessable.\r\n  * **Easy scene/room management**.\r\n  * Objects can be composed of several single images.\r\n  * **Automatic object pooling**.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
