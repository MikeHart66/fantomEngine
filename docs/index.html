You can post issues/bug reports at the new <a href="http://forum.fantomgl.com" target="_blank">support forum</a>. <br>The forum is also a good place to ask your questions about how to use <b>fantomEngine</b> or make suggestions about needed features.<br><h2>Features</h2><b>fantomEngine</b> currently supports the following features: <br><ul><li>Various objects like images, tile maps, graphic primitives, sounds, collision zones and layers.<br><li>Automatic processes to create, update and render objects.<br><li>Callback methods which are called during the handling of an object, layer, timer and transitions.<br><li>Layer transitions with callback methods.<br><li>Object transitions for position, rotation, scaling and alpha values with callback methods.<br><li>Several equation and ease types for object and layer transitions.<br><li>Object timers with callback methods.<br><li>Different collision methods with callback methods.<br><li>Touch input handling with callback methods.<br><li>Organize your objects in layers.<br><li>Automatic content scaling via providing a virtual canvas setup.<br><li>Simple high-score list loading, saving and updating.<br><li>Simple sound loading which handles the proper file extension depending on the chosen platform. <br><li>Support for bitmap font text objects which load EzGUI font descriptions.<br><li>Build-in frames per second calculator.<br><li>Extensive handling methods for the engine's objects.<br><li>Simple camera support which you can move around to render parts of your scenery.<br><li>Support for texture maps (atlas) created by the tool TexturePacker.<br><li>Support for tile maps created by the tool Tiled.<br><li>Engine time scaling supporting object updates, timers and transitions.<br><li>Automatic swipe gesture detection with event method.<br><li>Path/Waypoint handling. Let your objects follow them.<br><li>A* pathfinding und user definable grids of nodes. It doesn't have to be a grid of squares!<br><li>Easy integration of Box2D powered physics including ray casting. Physics definition created by the tool PhysicsEditor are supported too.<br><li>Localize your game easily with easy support of multiple languages.<br><li>Support different key maps for different controllers or user definitions.<br><li>Embedded objects inside a Tiled map will be stored and are accessable.<br><li>Easy scene/room management.<br><li>Objects can be composed of several single images.<br><li>Automatic object pooling.</ul><br><blockquote>Copyright (c) 2011-2015 Michael Hartlef<br><br>Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software, and to permit persons to whom the software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:<br><br>The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the software.<br><br>THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
